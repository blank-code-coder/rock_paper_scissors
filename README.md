# rock_paper_scissors

This is a simple game of rock paper scissors played entirely in the browser console. The program was built entirely with HTML and Javascript. The user will be prompted to input one of the three options, this will go on for five rounds. Remember to press F12 to open the browser console to see the results. There are some improvements that can be made, like having an option to cancel mid round, checking user input to make sure its correct and so on. For the time being, its a simple but fun implementaion of the game which I learned a lot from and will be taking its lessons with me moving forward.
